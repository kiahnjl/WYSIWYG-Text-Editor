## Status: WIP

The goal is to get an idea of what it takes to build a text editor.
From scratch.

I'm building it up from vanilla JavaScript to get practice at:
- choosing the right framework(s)
- creating a minimal solution
- not over complicating things
- adding in build automation

There will be global variables until a proper module system has been
setup - bear with me.
